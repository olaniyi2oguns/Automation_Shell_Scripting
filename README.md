# Automation_Shell_Scripting
User Onboarding Automation with Shell Scripting This project automates the process of onboarding Linux users by reading their first names from a CSV file and creating new users on a server. Each new user is automatically added to the developers group, provided with a home directory, and given a preconfigured SSH setup with your public key.
